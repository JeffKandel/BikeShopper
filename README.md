# Bike Shopper

Bike Shopper is not a store and was never intended to be one. It is a design project with some meat on its bones. After reading a lot about functional CSS, I was looking for a larger sandbox to explore functional CSS alongside React. I decided to strip the CSS from an old project and start from scratch with the Tachyons functional CSS library. The site you see is a result of this experimentation.

After working with Tachyons and React, I feel really positive about the combination. Functional CSS feels close to the styling metal and the practice of writing out each class reinforced CSS fundamentals along the way. Embedding these styles in React components ensured that maintanence and consistency were non-issues. Tachyons is definitely a tool I will use again.
